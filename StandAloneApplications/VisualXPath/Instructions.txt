Installation directions:
1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Extract all the files into a directory, something like "C:\VXPath" would make sense.
   [Make sure you select the option to "use folder names" when extracting the archive.]
3. Double click on VisualXPath.exe in the bin\Debug directory.


THIRD PARTY CLASSES:
I used the PerformanceDemo class showed in the Microsoft .NET Show by Francesco Baleno.
